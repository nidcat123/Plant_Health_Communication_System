# Plant_Health_Communication_System
The aim of this project is to develop a system that allows the user to monitor the health conditions of a plant using a microcontroller and sensors

An efficient system for plant communication is required for those
individuals that lead a faced pace life. The proposed system allows
the user to view the health parameters of a plant along with a
measure of how well it is being taken care of.
The tool expresses factors such as the humidity levels, moisture
levels and exposure to sunlight by using an LCD display screen
and an LED dot matrix.
It stores the data sets perceived and defines the status of the plant
by taking an average of the relevant parameters.
This way the user can always tell when they need to take better
care of the plant.
